1.X-ray images.
-> You can get X-ray images of both COVID and NON-COVID Patients on Kaggle Dataset.
-> Just go to google and  search for "kaggle"
-> After entering into Kaggle,search for COVID-19 X-ray Dataset.

2. Machine for training,testing and getting frozen file of the model
-> You need to have a good machine for training and testing of this model.
-> I had  used GOOGLE COLAB. If your Machine has good computational power and high GPU,then you can train this model in your laptop or computer
   using any suitable python IDE.

2.Raspberry Pi-4B
-> You need to have Raspberry Pi-4B Hardware for the deployment of this image classfication model.
-> Also,you need to install required libraries like CV2,Numpy,Tensorflow 2.0,and Rpi.GPIO

3.LEDS
-> You need to have two LEDS for indicating signals for postive or negative status.
